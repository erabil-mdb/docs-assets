============================
Documentation Project Assets
============================

This repository hosts images and other assets for MongoDB
documentation projects. The build system for relevant sites, clones
this repository and checks out the appropriate branch for the
production site.

All images in the MongoDB manual, with two exceptions, are generated
at build time from svg sources.
